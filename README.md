# 🎯 Final Project: Emotion Detection Web Application

## 🔍 Overview

Welcome to your final project! This task is designed to showcase your ability to build and deploy a web-based application using Flask and IBM Watson NLP services. Your challenge is to create an **Emotion Detection Web App** that can analyze user-submitted text and detect underlying emotions such as **joy**, **anger**, **fear**, and more.

This project combines natural language processing with web development, giving you hands-on experience in AI integration and full-stack deployment.

## 🧠 What is Emotion Detection?

Emotion detection expands on basic sentiment analysis by identifying more specific emotions like **sadness**, **disgust**, **joy**, **fear**, and **anger**. It's a powerful tool used in various domains including:

- Recommendation systems  
- Customer service chatbots  
- Mental health analysis  
- Social media monitoring  

This project uses **IBM Watson NLP** to bring emotion detection into a web interface.

## ✅ Project Tasks

Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved in this project:

### 📥 Task 1: Clone the GitHub Repository
Begin by cloning the modified version of the project repository from:
```
https://github.com/KruBro/emotion-detector.git
```

### 🛠️ Task 2: Build the Emotion Detection App
Develop a Python-based application using **Watson NLP** to analyze input text and return emotion scores.

### 🎨 Task 3: Format the Output
Ensure your output is clearly structured and easy to read. It should show individual emotion scores and identify the dominant emotion.

### 📦 Task 4: Prepare the App for Deployment
Organize your project files, dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`), and configuration so the app can be easily deployed.

### 🧪 Task 5: Implement Unit Tests
Write unit tests to verify your emotion detection logic is working correctly. Make use of Python’s `unittest` framework.

### 🌐 Task 6: Deploy the App Using Flask
Deploy the app as a web service using the Flask framework. Users should be able to interact with it through a browser interface.

### ⚠️ Task 7: Add Error Handling
Add robust error handling, especially for edge cases like empty input. Ensure the app responds with user-friendly messages.

### 🧹 Task 8: Run Static Code Analysis
Use tools like `pylint` or `flake8` to analyze your code for style and quality. Address any major issues that arise.
